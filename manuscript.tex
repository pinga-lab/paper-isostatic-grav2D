\section{Introduction}

Several methods have been proposed for using gravity and/or magnetic data to estimate
the boundaries of adjacent sedimentary layers, the relief of basement under sedimentary 
basins and/or the Mohorovicic discontinuity (or simply Moho), which separates crust and 
mantle.
These geophysical discontinuities represent, for such particular methods, 
density and/or magnetization contrasts in subsurface.
All these methods suffer from the inherent ambiguity \citep{roy1962, skeels1962} in
determining the true physical property distribution from a discrete set of
observed potential-field data. 
It is well known that, by using different physical property values, it is possible to
find different interfaces producing the same potential-field data. 
To partially overcome this problem and obtain meaningful solutions, the interpreter
must commonly use priori information obtained from seismic data and/or boreholes in
order to constrain the range of possible models.

There are methods that approximate the subsurface by a grid of
juxtaposed cells with constant physical property. 
Then they estimate the physical property value of each cell and finally 
use the estimated values to estimate the geometry of the geophysical discontinuities.
Notice that, in this case, the geometry of the geophysical discontinuities are
estimated in an indirect way. Although very useful in geophysics, such methods are
outside the scope of the present work.
Here, we consider methods that represent discontinuities by interfaces 
separating layers with constant or depth-dependent physical property distribution 
(density and/or magnetization).
In this case, the geometry of the geophysical discontinuities are directly determined
by estimating the geometrical parameters describing the interfaces.

Different criteria can be used to classify these methods.
Those applied over a sedimentary basin, for example, are considered local scale methods,
whereas those applied over a continent or country are considered regional scale methods
and those applied over the whole globe are considered global scale methods.
Examples of local scale methods estimating the geometry of a single
interface separating two layers were presented by
% scale: local | data: gravity | domain: space
\citet{bott1960, tanner1967, cordell-henderson1968, dyrelius-vogel1972, pedersen1977,
pilkington-crossley1986, richardson-macinnes1989, barbosa-etal1997, 
barbosa-etal1999, barbosa-etal1999b, silva-etal2006, pilkington2006, 
chakravarthi-sundararajan2007, martins-etal2010, silva-etal2010, lima-etal2011, 
martins-etal2011, barnes-barraud2012, silva-etal2014, silva-santos2017},
in the space domain, and 
% scale: local | data: gravity | domain: Fourier
\citet{oldenburg1974, granser1987, reamer-ferguson1989, guspi1993},
in the Fourier domain.
Most of these methods were applied to estimate the relief of basement under
a sedimentary basin.
Methods estimating a single interface representing the Moho, at regional
scale, were presented by 
% scale: regional | data: gravity | domain: space
\citet{shin-etal2009, bagherbandi-eshagh2012, barzaghi-biagi2014, sampietro2015, uieda-barbosa2017},
in space domain, and by 
% scale: regional | data: gravity | domain: Fourier
\citet{braitenberg-etal1997, braitenberg-zadro1999, vandermeijde-etal2013}
in Fourier domain.
There are also some global scale methods 
% scale: global | data: gravity | domain: space
\citep[e.g.,][]{sunkel1985, sjoberg2009}.

The regional and global scale methods usually presume that the interface representing
the Moho oscillates around a reference depth.

The regional and global scale methods usually presume that the crust and mantle are
at isostatic equilibrium.

MULTILAYER METHODS

The second group of methods is formed by those estimating multiple interfaces
separating layers with constant physical properties.

\citep{pilkington-crossley1986b, gallardo-etal2005, camacho-etal2011, salem-etal2014}

All these methods have been applied at local scale, to characterize a single 
sedimentary basin, for example.

The number of methods forming this group is significantly lower than that
of the other one.

They suffer from a greater ambiguity if compared to those of the first group. 
Consequently, the methods forming the second group require more priori information to
decrease the number of possible solutions.

Few methods using gravity data have imposed isostatic equilibrium to
the estimated interface(s).

Most of them estimate a single interface representing the Moho \citep[e.g.,][]{bagherbandi-eshagh2012, sampietro2015, sjoberg2009}.

These methods are applied at regional and global scales.

\citet{salem-etal2014} presented one of the few methods that impose isostatic
equilibrium to a set of two interfaces representing the basement and Moho 
geometries under a sedimentary basin, at local scale.




\section{Methodology}


\subsection{Forward problem}


Let $\mathbf{d}^{o}$ be the observed data vector, whose $i$-th element $d^{o}_{i}$, 
$i = 1, \dots, N$, represent the observed gravity disturbance at the point 
$(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, on a profile located over a rifted passive margin. The
coordinates are referred to a topocentric Cartesian system, with $z$ axis pointing
downward, $y$-axis along the profile and $x$-axis perpendicular to the profile. 
We assume that actual mass distribution in a rifted passive margin can be schematically
represented according to Figure \ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}. 
In this model, the subsurface is formed by four layers. 
The first and shallowest one represents a water layer with constant density
$\rho^{(w)}$. 
The second layer is formed by $Q$ vertically adjacent parts representing sediments,
salt or volcanic rocks.
In our example, this layer is formed by two parts with constant densities
$\rho^{(q)}$, $q = 1, 2$. 
The third layer of our model represents the crust. For simplicity, we presume that the
crust density may be equal to $\rho^{(cc)}$, for $y_{i} \le y_{COT}$, which
represents the continental crust, or equal to $\rho^{(oc)}$, for $y_{i} > y_{COT}$,
which represents the oceanic crust.
The deepest layer represents a homogeneous mantle with constant density
$\rho^{(m)}$. 
The interface separating the second and third layers defines the basement relief whereas
that separating the third and fourth layers defines the Moho. these interfaces are represented as white-dashed lines in Figure \ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}. 
In order to define the anomalous mass distribution producing the observed gravity
disturbance data, we presume a reference mass distribution formed by two homogeneous
layers (Figure \ref{fig:reference-mass-distribution}). The shallowest layer represents 
the crust, the deepest layer represents the mantle and the interface separating them
is conveniently called reference Moho.
The reference mass distribution can be thought of as the outer layers of a concentric
mass distribution producing the normal gravity field.

We consider that the anomalous mass distribution producing the observed data
is defined as the difference between the rifted margin model (Figure
\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}) and the reference mass distribution (Figure
\ref{fig:reference-mass-distribution}).
This anomalous mass distribution is approximated by an interpretation model 
formed by $N$ adjacent columns (Figure \ref{fig:interpretation-model}). 
We consider that the prisms in the 
extremities of the interpretation model extend to infinity along the $y$ axis 
in order to prevent edge effects in the forward calculations. 
The $i$-th column is formed by four vertically adjacent 
layers, which in turn are composed of vertically adjacent prisms having infinite 
length along the $x$-axis. 

The first and shallowest layer represents the water layer, 
is formed by a single prism, has thickness $t^{w}_{i}$ and a constant density contrast 
$\Delta \rho^{w} = \rho^{w} - \rho^{r}$, where $\rho^{w}$ and $\rho^{r}$ 
represents, respectively, the densities of water and the reference mass 
distribution (Figure \ref{fig:reference-mass-distribution}) at the same point.
The third layer represents the crust, it is also formed by a single prism,
has thickness $t^{c}_{i}$ and density contrast 
$\Delta \rho^{c}_{i} = \rho^{c} - \rho^{r}$, 
with $\rho^{c}$ being the crust density. For simplicity, we presume that the crust
density $\rho^{c}_{i}$ may be equal to $\rho^{cc}$, for $y_{i} \le y_{COT}$, which
represents continental crust,
or equal to $\rho^{oc}$, for $y_{i} > y_{COT}$, which represents oceanic crust.
The crust density depends on the position of the $i$-th column with respect to
$y_{COT}$, which defines an abrupt Crust-Ocean Transition (COT). Consequently, the
crust may have two possible density contrasts: 
$\Delta \rho^{c}_{i} = \rho^{cc} - \rho{r}$ or 
$\Delta \rho^{c}_{i} = \rho^{oc} - \rho^{r}$. The top of this layer defines the 
basement relief and its bottom the relief of the Moho. The fourth layer represents the
mantle, it is divided into two parts, each one formed by a single prism having the same
density $\rho^{m}$ and, consequently, the same density contrast 
$\Delta \rho^{m} = \rho^{m} - \rho^{r}$. The shallowest
portion of this layer has thickness $t^{m}_{i}$. Its top and bottom define,
respectively, the depths of Moho and the planar isostatic compensation layer $S_{0}$.
The deepest portion of the fourth layer has thickness $\Delta S_{0}$, top at the
surface $S_{0}$ and bottom at the planar surface 
$S_{0} + \Delta S_{0}$, which defines the Moho in the reference mass distribution model 
(Figure \ref{fig:reference-mass-distribution}). Finally, the second layer forming the
$t$-th column of the interpretation model is defined by the interpreter, according to
the geological environment to be studied and the a priori information availability. 
As a general rule, this layer can be defined by a set of $Q$ vertically adjacent
prisms, each one with thickness $t^{q}_{i}$, density $\rho^{q}$ and density contrast
$\Delta \rho^{q} = \rho^{q} - \rho^{r}$, $q = 1, \dots Q$.

Given the density contrasts, the COT position $y_{COT}$, the isostatic compensation
surface $S_{0}$, the thickness of the water layer and of the $Q-1$ prisms forming the
shallowest portion of the second layer, it is possible to describe the interpretation
model in terms of an $M \times 1$ parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$, $M = 2N + 1$, defined
as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{t}^{Q} \\
\mathbf{t}^{m} \\
\Delta S_{0}
\end{bmatrix} \: ,
\label{eq:parameter-vector}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{t}^{Q}$ and $\mathbf{t}^{m}$ are $N \times 1$ vectors whose $i$-th
elements $t^{Q}_{i}$ and $t^{m}_{i}$ represent, respectively, the thickness of the
prism forming the deepest portion of the second layer and the thickness of the prism
forming the shallowest portion of the fourth layer of the interpretation model.
In this case, the gravity disturbance produced by the interpretation model (the
predicted gravity disturbance) at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ can be written
as the sum of the vertical component of the gravitational attraction exerted by the $L$
prisms forming the interpretation model as follows:
\begin{equation}
d_{i}(\mathbf{p}) = k_{g} \, G \, \sum_{j = 1}^{L} f_{ij}(\mathbf{p}) \: ,
\label{eq:ith-predicted-data}
\end{equation}
where $f_{ij}(\mathbf{p})$ represents an integral over the volume of the $j$-th 
prism. Here, these volume integrals are computed with the expressions proposed 
by \citet{nagy-etal2000}, by using the open-source Python package 
\textit{Fatiando a Terra} \citep{uieda-etal2013}.


\subsection{Inverse problem}


Let $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{p})$ be the predicted data vector, whose $i$-th element
$d_{i}(\mathbf{p})$ is defined by Equation \ref{eq:ith-predicted-data}. Estimating the
particular parameter vector $\mathbf{p} = \hat{\mathbf{p}}$ producing a predicted data
vector $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{p})$ as close as possible to the observed data vector 
$\mathbf{d}^{o}$ can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the goal function
\begin{equation}
\Gamma (\mathbf{p}) = \Phi(\mathbf{p}) + \mu \sum_{k = 0}^{3} \alpha_{k}
\Psi_{k}(\mathbf{p}) \: ,
\label{eq:goal-function}
\end{equation}
subject to all elements of $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ be positive. In Equation
\ref{eq:goal-function}, $\mu$ represents the regularizing parameter, $\Phi(\mathbf{p})$
represents the misfit function given by
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{N} \| \mathbf{d}^{o} - \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{p}) \|_{2}^{2} 
\: , 
\label{eq:misfit-function}
\end{equation}
where $\| \cdot \|_{2}^{2}$ represents the squared Euclidean norm, $\alpha_{k}$
represent the weights assigned to the regularizing functions $\Psi_{k}(\mathbf{p})$,
with define the constraints on the parameters to be estimated, $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.

\subsection{Airy constraint}

Consider that the interpretation model is in isostatic equilibrium according to the
Airy model \citep{turcotte-schubert2002, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005, lowrie2007}.
In this case, the pressure (or lithostatic stress) exerted by the model is constant 
on the isostatic compensation surface $S_{0}$. The pressure per unit area 
exerted by the $i$-th column of the model on $S_{0}$, divided by gravity, 
is given by:
\begin{equation}
t^{w}_{i} \rho^{w} + t^{1}_{i} \rho^{1}_{i} + \dots + t^{Q}_{i} \rho^{Q}_{i} + 
t^{c}_{i} \rho^{c}_{i} + t^{m}_{i} \rho^{m} = \sigma_{0} \: ,
\label{eq:lithostatic-stress-densities}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{0}$ is an arbitrary positive constant. Rearranging terms in Equation
\ref{eq:lithostatic-stress-densities} and using the relation
\begin{equation}
S_{0} = t^{w}_{i} + t^{1}_{i} + \dots + t^{Q}_{i} + t^{c}_{i} + t^{m}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:S0}
\end{equation}
it is possible to show that:
\begin{equation}
(\rho^{Q}_{i} - \rho^{c}_{i}) \, t^{Q}_{i} + (\rho^{m} - \rho^{c}_{i}) \, t^{m}_{i} +
(\rho^{w} - \rho^{c}_{i}) \, t^{w}_{i} + (\rho^{1}_{i} - \rho^{c}_{i}) \, t^{1}_{i} +
\dots + (\rho^{Q-1}_{i} - \rho^{c}_{i}) \, t^{Q-1}_{i} + \rho^{c}_{i} \, S_{0} =
\sigma_{0} \: .
\label{eq:lithostatic-stress-density-contrasts}
\end{equation}
In order to describe the pressure exerted by all columns forming the interpretation
model on the surface $S_{0}$, Equation \ref{eq:lithostatic-stress-density-contrasts}
can be written, in matrix notation, as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}^{Q} \mathbf{t}^{Q} + \mathbf{M}^{m} \mathbf{t}^{m} + \mathbf{M}^{w}
\mathbf{t}^{w} + \mathbf{M}^{1} \mathbf{t}^{1} + \dots + \mathbf{M}^{Q-1}
\mathbf{t}^{Q-1} + \boldsymbol{\rho}^{c} S_{0} = \sigma_{0} \mathbf{1} \: ,
\label{eq:lithostatic-stress-matrix}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{1}$ is an $N \times 1$ vector with all elements equal to one, 
$\mathbf{t}^{\alpha}$ are $N \times 1$ vectors with $i$-th element defined by the
thickness $t^{\alpha}_{i}$ of a prism forming the $i$-th column, 
$\alpha = w, 1, \dots, Q-1, Q, m$, and $\mathbf{M}^{Q}$, $\mathbf{M}^{m}$, 
$\mathbf{M}^{w}$, $\mathbf{M}^{1}$, \dots, $\mathbf{M}^{Q-1}$ are $N \times N$ diagonal
matrices with elements $ii$ of main diagonal are given by density contrasts
$(\rho^{Q}_{i} - \rho^{c}_{i})$, $(\rho^{m} - \rho^{c}_{i})$, 
$(\rho^{w} - \rho^{c}_{i})$, $(\rho^{1}_{i} - \rho^{c}_{i})$ and $\dots$,
$(\rho^{Q-1}_{i} - \rho^{c}_{i})$, respectively, and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^{c}$ is an 
$N \times 1$ vector containing the densities of the prisms
representing the crust. By applying the first-order Tikhonov regularization
\citep{aster-etal2005} to the constant vector $\sigma_{0} \mathbf{1}$, we obtain the
following expression:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} \left( \mathbf{C} \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{t} \right) = \mathbf{0} 
\: ,
\label{eq:tik1-lithostatic-stress}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{0}$ is a vector with null elements and the remaining terms are given by:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{M}^{Q} & \mathbf{M}^{m} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix}_{N \times M} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-C}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{M}^{w} & \mathbf{M}^{1} & \cdots & \mathbf{M}^{Q-1} & \boldsymbol{\rho}^{c}
\end{bmatrix}_{N \times \left( QN + 1 \right)} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-D}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{t} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{t}^{w} \\ \mathbf{t}^{1} \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{t}^{Q-1} \\ S_{0}
\end{bmatrix}_{\left( QN + 1 \right) \times 1}\: ,
\label{eq:vector-t}
\end{equation}
$\mathbf{p}$ is the parameter vector (Equation \ref{eq:parameter-vector}) and
$\mathbf{R}$ is an $\left( N-1 \right) \times N$ matrix, whose element $ij$ is defined
as follows:
\begin{equation}
\left[ \mathbf{R} \right]_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 &, \quad j = i \\
-1 &, \quad j = i + 1 \\
0 &, \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \quad .
\label{eq:matrix-R}
\end{equation}
Finally, from Equation \ref{eq:tik1-lithostatic-stress}, it is possible to
define the regularizing function $\Psi_{0}(\mathbf{p})$ 
(Equation \ref{eq:goal-function}): 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{0}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{R} \left( \mathbf{C} \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{D}
\mathbf{t} \right) \|_{2}^{2} \: .
\label{eq:airy-constraint-function}
\end{equation}
We call this function as \textit{Airy constraint}. Notice that minimizing this
function imposes smoothness on the pressure exerted by the interpretation model on 
the isostatic compensation surface $S_{0}$.


\subsection{Smoothness constraint}


This constraint imposes smoothness on the adjacent thickness of the prisms forming the
deepest portion of the second layer and the shallowest part of the fourth layer
of the interpretation model by applying the first-order Tikhonov regularization
\citep{aster-etal2005} to the vectors $\mathbf{t}^{Q}$ and $\mathbf{t}^{m}$ 
(Equation \ref{eq:parameter-vector}). 
Mathematically, this constraint is represented by the regularizing function
$\Psi_{1}(\mathbf{p})$ (Equation \ref{eq:goal-function}):
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{1}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{S}\mathbf{p} \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:smootheness-contraint}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{S}$ is an $\left( N-1 \right) \times M$ matrix given by:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{R} & \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-S}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{R}$ is defined by Equation \ref{eq:matrix-R} and $\mathbf{0}$
is a vector with all elements equal to zero.


\subsection{Equality constraint}

\subsubsection*{Equality constraint on basement depths}

Let $\mathbf{a}$ be a vector whose $k$-th element $a_{k}$,
$k = 1, \dots, A$, is the known basement depth at the horizontal coordinate
$y^{A}_{k}$ of the profile. These known basement depth values are used to define 
the regularizing function $\Psi_{2}(\mathbf{p})$ 
(Equation \ref{eq:goal-function}):
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{2}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{A}\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a} \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:equality-constraint-basement}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ is an $A \times M$ matrix whose $k$-th line has one element 
equal to one and all the remaining elements equal to zero. The location of the
single non-null element in the $k$-th line of $\mathbf{A}$ depends on the coordinate
$y^{A}_{k}$ of the known basement depth $a_{k}$. Let us consider, 
for example, an interpretation model formed by $N = 10$ columns. Consider also that 
the basement depth at the coordinates $y^{A}_{1} = y_{4}$ and $y^{A}_{2} = y_{9}$ of
the profile are equal to $25$ and $35.7$ km, respectively. In this case, $A = 2$,
$\mathbf{a}$ is a $2 \times 1$ vector with elements $a_{1} = 25$ and $a_{2} = 35.7$
and $\mathbf{A}$ is a $2 \times M$ matrix ($M = 2N + 1 = 21$). The element $4$ of the
first line and the element $9$ of the second line of $\mathbf{A}$ are equal to $1$ and
all its remaining elements are equal to zero.

\subsubsection*{Equality constraint on Moho depths}

Let $\mathbf{b}$ be a vector whose $k$-th element $b_{k}$,
$k = 1, \dots, B$, is the difference between the isostatic compensation depth
$S_{0}$ and the known Moho depth at the horizontal coordinate $y^{B}_{k}$ of the
profile. These differences, which must be positive, are used to define the 
regularizing function $\Psi_{3}(\mathbf{p})$ (Equation \ref{eq:goal-function}):
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{3}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{B}\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{b} \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:equality-constraint-moho}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{B}$ is a $B \times M$ matrix whose $k$-th line has one element 
equal to one and all the remaining elements equal to zero. This matrix is defined 
in the same way as matrix $\mathbf{A}$ (Equation \ref{eq:equality-constraint-basement}).
