%We propose a new gravity inversion method for jointly estimating the basement and 
%Moho reliefs along a profile crossing a passive rifted margin.
%We approximate the subsurface by an interpretation model composed of 
%adjacent columns, each one formed by vertically stacked prisms having constant 
%and known density contrasts.
%Our method consists in solving a non-linear inverse problem to estimate the 
%thickness of specific prisms defining the basement and Moho geometries, 
%as well as a constant thickness defining the maximum depth of our interpretation 
%model.
%This maximum depth represents a planar reference Moho.
%To obtain stable solutions, we impose smoothness on the basement and Moho relief,
%force them to be close to known depths along the profile and also impose
%isostatic equilibrium according to the Airy-Heiskanen model.
%Our method imposes isostatic equilibrium by constraining the lithostatic stress 
%exerted by the interpretation model at a given constant depth, 
%below which there are no lateral density variations.
%This isostatic constraint introduces the information that the lithostatic stress 
%is mostly smooth, except at some isolated regions, where it can present abrupt 
%variations. At these regions, our method enables the interpretation model to deviate
%from the isostatic equilibrium.
%Tests with synthetic data show the good performance of our method in
%determining the basement and Moho geometries at regions with  
%pronounced crustal thinning, which is typical of passive volcanic margins.
%Results obtained by our method at the Pelotas basin, considered a classical example
%of passive volcanic margin at the southern of Brazil, agree with a previous
%interpretation obtained independently by using ultra-deep seismic data.
%The applications to synthetic and real data show that our method is a
%promising tool for interpreting gravity data on passive rifted margins.

\section{Applications to synthetic data - number of constraints}

We tested the method using different combinations of the constraints and show the results of only Step 2. Parameters defining the interpretation model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:volcanic-margin-model}.  We used the same parameters for inversion used in the synthetic applications of the paper.

Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2} and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3} show the estimated model obtained at the Step 2 and Step 3 of our algorithm using the four constraints described in the Inverse problem formulation section of the paper. The parameters $\tilde{\alpha}_{0}$, $\tilde{\alpha}_{1}$, $\tilde{\alpha}_{2}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}_{3}$ used to estimate the parameter vectors $\mathbf{p}^{(2)}$ and $\mathbf{p}^{(3)}$ have values $10^{2}$, $10^{1}$, $10^{1}$ and $10^{2}$, respectively.

Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test1} (equality constraints), Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2} (smoothness constraint), Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test3} (isostatic constraint), Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test4} (isostatic and smoothness constraints) and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test5} (smoothness and equality constraints) show the estimated model obtained at the end of Step 2 using different combinations of the constraints at the solution of the inverse problem. These models presented estimated basement and Moho reliefs with different geometries, however show predicted gravity disturbance with the same behavior that true one. We can observe smoothness in the lithostatic stress curve when the isostatic constraint is applied.

	The model extends from $y = 0$ km to $y = 383$ km, the Continent-Ocean 
	Transition (COT) is located at $y_{COT} = 350$ km and the reference 
	Moho is located at $S_{0} + \Delta S = 43.2$ km, where
