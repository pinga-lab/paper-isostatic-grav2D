%We propose a new gravity inversion method for jointly estimating the basement and 
%Moho reliefs along a profile crossing a passive rifted margin.
%We approximate the subsurface by an interpretation model composed of 
%adjacent columns, each one formed by vertically stacked prisms having constant 
%and known density contrasts.
%Our method consists in solving a non-linear inverse problem to estimate the 
%thickness of specific prisms defining the basement and Moho geometries, 
%as well as a constant thickness defining the maximum depth of our interpretation 
%model.
%This maximum depth represents a planar reference Moho.
%To obtain stable solutions, we impose smoothness on the basement and Moho relief,
%force them to be close to known depths along the profile and also impose
%isostatic equilibrium according to the Airy-Heiskanen model.
%Our method imposes isostatic equilibrium by constraining the lithostatic stress 
%exerted by the interpretation model at a given constant depth, 
%below which there are no lateral density variations.
%This isostatic constraint introduces the information that the lithostatic stress 
%is mostly smooth, except at some isolated regions, where it can present abrupt 
%variations. At these regions, our method enables the interpretation model to deviate
%from the isostatic equilibrium.
%Tests with synthetic data show the good performance of our method in
%determining the basement and Moho geometries at regions with  
%pronounced crustal thinning, which is typical of passive volcanic margins.
%Results obtained by our method at the Pelotas basin, considered a classical example
%of passive volcanic margin at the southern of Brazil, agree with a previous
%interpretation obtained independently by using ultra-deep seismic data.
%The applications to synthetic and real data show that our method is a
%promising tool for interpreting gravity data on passive rifted margins.

\section{Applications to synthetic data - Sensitivity to the initial approximation}

We tested the sensitivity to the initial approximation and show the results of Steps 2 e 3 by five different initial approximations used in Steps 1 (not shown) and 2. Parameters defining the interpretation model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:volcanic-margin-model}.  We used the same parameters for inversion used in the synthetic applications of the paper.

Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2} and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3} shows the estimated model obtained at the Step 2 and Step 3 of our algorithm with the initial approximation adopted in the applications of the paper. Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2} shows initial approximation nearly flat surfaces with geometry far of true surfaces. 
Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test1} and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2} show initial approximation surfaces nearly geometry of true surfaces, but Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2} considers the known depths at basement and Moho. In the same way, we considers only the known depths at basement and Moho to design initial approximation surfaces to Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test3}. Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test4} and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test5} exhibit flat initial approximation surfaces with thick crust and thin crust, respectively. 

All tests (Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test1}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test4} and~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test5}) presented estimated surfaces of Step 2 nearly the estimated surfaces in the synthetic applications of the paper (Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2}), except the test 5 estimated surfaces (Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test5}).

Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test1}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test2}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test3}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test4} and~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test5} shows the estimated model obtained at the Step 3 of our algorithm with different initial approximations used in Steps 1 and 2 (Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test1}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test4} and~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test5}). We used the same $\sigma$ constant of the applications of the paper ($\sigma = 21$) for all tests. We can see in the results the same behavior of gravity disturbance and lithostatic stress obtained in the applications of the paper (Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3}). The moho estimated surfaces have the same aspect for all results (Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test1}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test2}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test3}, ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test4} and~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test5}). The basement estimated surface obtained in the test 1 (Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test1}) is very similar to that of Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3}. The others tests show similar results of basement relief, but the region between $100$ and $200$ $km$ shows large differences each other (Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test2} and ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test4} and Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test3} and ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test5}).
