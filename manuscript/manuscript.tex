\section{Introduction}

Several methods have been proposed for using gravity and/or magnetic data to estimate
the boundaries of juxtaposed sedimentary layers, the relief of basement under sedimentary 
basins and/or the Mohorovicic discontinuity (or simply Moho), which separates crust and 
mantle.
These geophysical discontinuities represent, for such particular methods, 
density and/or magnetization contrasts in subsurface.
All these methods suffer from the inherent ambiguity \citep{roy1962, skeels1962} in
determining the true physical property distribution that produces a discrete set of
observed potential-field data. 
It is well known that, by using different density and/or magnetization contrasts, 
it is possible to
find different surfaces producing the same potential-field data. 
To partially overcome this problem and obtain meaningful solutions, the interpreter
must commonly use priori information obtained from seismic data and/or boreholes in
order to constrain the range of possible models.

There are methods that approximate the subsurface by a grid of
juxtaposed cells with constant physical property. 
They estimate the physical property value of each cell and then 
interpret the estimated values to indirectly estimate the geometry of the 
geophysical discontinuities.
Although very useful in geophysics, such methods are
outside the scope of the present work.
Here, we consider methods that represent discontinuities by surfaces 
separating layers with constant or depth-dependent physical property distribution 
(density and/or magnetization).
In this case, the geometry of the geophysical discontinuities are directly determined
by estimating the geometrical parameters describing the surfaces.

Different criteria can be used to classify the methods that directly estimate
the geometry of geophysical discontinuities.
Those applied over a sedimentary basin, for example, can be considered local scale methods,
whereas those applied over a continent or country can be considered regional scale methods
and those applied over the whole globe can be considered global scale methods.
They can also be classified according to the number of geophysical surfaces
to be estimated.

By using these criteria, it is possible to define a first group of methods
estimating the geometry of a single interface.
In this group, there are local scale methods in space domain
% scale: local | data: gravity | domain: space
\citep[e.g.,][]{bott1960, tanner1967, cordell-henderson1968, dyrelius-vogel1972, pedersen1977,
pilkington-crossley1986, richardson-macinnes1989, barbosa-etal1997, 
barbosa-etal1999, barbosa-etal1999b, silva-etal2006, pilkington2006, 
chakravarthi-sundararajan2007, martins-etal2010, silva-etal2010, lima-etal2011, 
martins-etal2011, barnes-barraud2012, silva-etal2014, silva-santos2017},
and Fourier domain
% scale: local | data: gravity | domain: Fourier
\citep[e.g.,][]{oldenburg1974, granser1987, reamer-ferguson1989, guspi1993}.
Most of these methods were applied to estimate the relief of basement under
a sedimentary basin.
There are also regional scale methods for estimating a single interface 
representing the Moho in spaced domain 
% scale: regional | data: gravity | domain: space
\citep[e.g.,][]{shin-etal2009, bagherbandi-eshagh2012, barzaghi-biagi2014, sampietro2015, uieda-barbosa2017} and in Fourier domain 
% scale: regional | data: gravity | domain: Fourier
\citep[e.g.,][]{braitenberg-etal1997, braitenberg-zadro1999, vandermeijde-etal2013}.
Additionally, there are some global scale methods for estimating the Moho
in spaced domain
% scale: global | data: gravity | domain: space
\citep[e.g.,][]{sunkel1985, sjoberg2009}.

The second group of methods is formed by those estimating multiple surfaces
separating layers with constant or depth-dependent physical properties 
\citep[e.g.,][]{pilkington-crossley1986b, gallardo-etal2005, camacho-etal2011, 
salem-etal2014}.
All these methods have been applied at local scale, to characterize a single 
sedimentary basin.
The number of methods forming this group is significantly lower than that
in the first one.
Additionally, the methods forming the second group suffer from a greater 
ambiguity and, as a consequence, they require more priori information to
decrease the number of possible solutions.

Among those directly estimating the geometry of the surfaces, 
there are some regional and global scale methods in space domain that impose 
some degree of isostatic equilibrium to the estimated models 
\citep[e.g.,][]{sunkel1985, sjoberg2009, bagherbandi-eshagh2012, sampietro2015}
or analyze their deviations from a perfect isostatic equilibrium
\citep[e.g.,][]{shin-etal2009}.
\citet{salem-etal2014} presented one of the few local scale 
methods in space domain that simultaneously estimates the basement and Moho
reliefs by imposing isostatic equilibrium. 
They imposed a perfect isostatic equilibrium according to
the Airy's local compensation model \citep{turcotte-schubert2002}, 
which describes well the transition
from continental to oceanic crust at rifted margins 
\citep{worzel1968, watts-moore2017}.

Here, we present a new local scale method for simultaneously estimating the geometries
of basement and Moho along a profile on a passive rifted margin.
Our method is formulated, in space domain, as a non-linear gravity inversion.
In order to produce stable solutions and introduce priori information,
we use different constraints imposing smoothness and lower/upper 
bounds on basement and Moho depths, as well as proximity between estimated 
and known depths at some points along the profile. We also use a constraint
(which we conveniently call as \textit{isostatic constraint}) imposing smoothness
on the lithostatic stress exerted on a planar surface located at depth,
below which we assume that there is no lateral density variations.
We considered that no vertical forces are acting on the lateral surfaces of 
each column forming the lithosphere.
Notice that, by imposing smoothness on the lithostatic stress,
our method does not estimate a model in perfect isostatic equilibrium, 
but a model as close as possible to the isostatic equilibrium.
Tests with synthetic data show the performance of our method in simultaneously
retrieving the geometry of basement and Moho of different models. 
We also analyze the influence of the isostatic constraint on the estimated
surfaces at regions showing abrupt crustal thinning, which is
typically shown in volcanic passive margins \citep{geoffroy2005}.
Finally, we illustrate the performance of our method by inverting 
satellite gravity data on a profile over the Pelotas basin \citep{stica-etal2014}, 
which is located at the southern of Brazil and is considered a classical example 
of volcanic passive margin.


\section{Methodology}


\subsection{Forward problem}


Let $\mathbf{d}^{o}$ be the observed data vector, whose $i$-th element $d^{o}_{i}$, 
$i = 1, \dots, N$, represent the observed gravity disturbance at the point 
$(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, on a profile located over a rifted passive margin. The
coordinates are referred to a topocentric Cartesian system, with $z$ axis pointing
downward, $y$-axis along the profile and $x$-axis perpendicular to the profile. 
We assume that the actual mass distribution in a rifted passive margin can be 
schematically represented according to Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}. 
In this model, the subsurface is formed by four layers. 
The first and shallowest one represents a water layer with constant density
$\rho^{(w)}$. 
The second layer is formed by $Q$ vertically adjacent parts representing sediments,
salt or volcanic rocks.
In our example, this layer is formed by two parts with constant densities
$\rho^{(q)}$, $q = 1, 2$. Different models can be created by changing the number $Q$.
The third layer of our model represents the crust. For simplicity, we presume that the
crust density may be equal to $\rho^{(cc)}$, which
represents the continental crust, or equal to $\rho^{(oc)}$, which represents the
oceanic crust.
The deepest layer represents a homogeneous mantle with constant density $\rho^{(m)}$. 
The interface separating the second and third layers defines the basement relief whereas
that separating the third and fourth layers defines the Moho. These surfaces are
represented by dashed-white lines in Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}.
We also presume the existence of an isostatic compensation depth at $S_{0}$ 
(represented as a continuous white line in Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}),
below which there is no lateral variations in the mass distribution.

In order to define the anomalous mass distribution producing the observed gravity
disturbance, we presume a reference mass distribution formed by two 
layers (not shown). The shallowest layer represents a homogeneous crust with constant
density $\rho^{(r)}$.
The deepest layer in the reference mass distribution represents a homogeneous mantle
with constant density $\rho^{(m)}$. Notice that the mantle in the reference mass 
distribution has the same density as the mantle in our rifted margin model
(Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}).
The interface separating the crust and mantle in the reference mass distribution 
is conveniently called \textit{reference Moho} (represented as a continuous white line
in Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}).
The reference model can be thought of as the outer layers of a concentric
mass distribution producing the normal gravity field.

We consider that the anomalous mass distribution producing the observed data
is defined as the difference between the rifted margin model 
(Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}) and the reference mass distribution (not shown).
As a consequence, the anomalous mass distribution is characterized by regions
with constant density contrast.
This anomalous distribution is approximated by an interpretation model 
formed by $N$ columns of vertically stacked prisms 
(Figure~\ref{fig:interpretation-model}).
For convenience, we presume that there is an observed gravity disturbance over the
center of each column.
We consider that the prisms in the extremities of the interpretation model extend to
infinity along the $y$ axis in order to prevent edge effects in the forward 
calculations. 
The $i$-th column is formed by four vertically adjacent layers, which in turn are
composed of vertically adjacent prisms having infinite length along the $x$-axis.

The first and shallowest layer represents water, 
is formed by a single prism, has thickness $t^{(w)}_{i}$ and a constant density
contrast $\Delta \rho^{(w)} = \rho^{(w)} - \rho^{(r)}$.
The second layer forming the $i$-th column of the interpretation model is defined by
the interpreter, according to the geological environment to be studied and the a priori
information availability. 
As a general rule, this layer can be defined by a set of $Q$ vertically adjacent
prisms, each one with thickness $t^{(q)}_{i}$ and constant density contrast
$\Delta \rho^{(q)} = \rho^{(q)} - \rho^{(r)}$, $q = 1, \dots Q$.
The third layer represents the crust, it is also formed by a single prism,
has thickness $t^{(c)}_{i}$ and density contrast 
$\Delta \rho^{(c)}_{i} = \rho^{(c)} - \rho^{(r)}$, 
with $\rho^{c}$ being the crust density. 
According to our rifted margin model (Figure~\ref{fig:rifted-margin-model}), the crust
density $\rho^{(c)}_{i}$ may assume two possible values, depending on its position
with respect to the $y_{COT}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:interpretation-model}).
As a consequence, the prisms forming the third layer of the interpretation model may
have two possible density contrasts: $\Delta \rho^{(c)}_{i} = \rho^{(cc)} - \rho^{(r)}$,
for $y_{i} \le y_{COT}$, or $\Delta \rho^{(c)}_{i} = \rho^{(oc)} - \rho^{(r)}$,
for $y_{i} > y_{COT}$. 
The top of this layer defines the basement relief and its bottom the relief of the
Moho. 
The fourth layer represents the mantle, it is divided into two parts, each one formed
by a single prism having a constant density contrast 
$\Delta \rho^{(m)} = \rho^{(m)} - \rho^{(r)}$. The shallowest
portion of this layer has thickness $t^{(m)}_{i}$. Its top and bottom define,
respectively, the depths of Moho and the planar isostatic compensation layer $S_{0}$.
The deepest portion of the fourth layer has thickness $\Delta S_{0}$, top at the
surface $S_{0}$ and bottom at the planar surface 
$S_{0} + \Delta S_{0}$, which defines the reference Moho. 


Given the density contrasts, the COT position $y_{COT}$, the isostatic compensation
depth $S_{0}$, the thickness of the water layer and of the $Q-1$ prisms forming the
shallowest portion of the second layer, it is possible to describe the interpretation
model in terms of an $M \times 1$ parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$, $M = 2N + 1$, defined
as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{t}^{Q} \\
\mathbf{t}^{m} \\
\Delta S_{0}
\end{bmatrix} \: ,
\label{eq:parameter-vector}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{t}^{Q}$ and $\mathbf{t}^{m}$ are $N \times 1$ vectors whose $i$-th
elements $t^{Q}_{i}$ and $t^{m}_{i}$ represent, respectively, the thickness of the
prism forming the deepest portion of the second layer and the thickness of the prism
forming the shallowest portion of the fourth layer of the interpretation model.
As a consequence, $t^{Q}_{i}$ and $t^{m}_{i}$ approximate, respectively, the geometry
of basement relief and Moho.
In this case, the gravity disturbance produced by the interpretation model (the
predicted gravity disturbance) at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ can be written
as the sum of the vertical component of the gravitational attraction exerted by the $L$
prisms forming the interpretation model as follows:
\begin{equation}
d_{i}(\mathbf{p}) = k_{g} \, G \, \sum_{j = 1}^{L} f_{ij}(\mathbf{p}) \: ,
\label{eq:ith-predicted-data}
\end{equation}
where $f_{ij}(\mathbf{p})$ represents an integral over the volume of the $j$-th 
prism. Here, these volume integrals are computed with the expressions proposed 
by \citet{nagy-etal2000}, by using the open-source Python package 
\textit{Fatiando a Terra} \citep{uieda-etal2013}.


\subsection{Inverse problem formulation}


Let $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{p})$ be the predicted data vector, whose $i$-th element
$d_{i}(\mathbf{p})$ is the vertical component of the gravitational attraction
(equation~\ref{eq:ith-predicted-data}) exerted by the interpretation model
at the position $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ on the profile.
Estimating the particular parameter vector producing a predicted data
$\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{p})$ as close as possible to the observed data 
$\mathbf{d}^{o}$ can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the goal function
\begin{equation}
\Gamma (\mathbf{p}) = \Phi(\mathbf{p}) + \sum_{\ell = 0}^{3} \alpha_{\ell}
\Psi_{\ell}(\mathbf{p}) \: ,
\label{eq:goal-function}
\end{equation}
subject to the inequality constraint 
\begin{equation}
p_{j}^{min} < p_{j} < p_{j}^{max} \: , \quad j = 1, \dots, M \: ,
\label{eq:inequality-constraint}
\end{equation}
where $p_{j}^{min}$ and $p_{j}^{max}$ define, respectively, lower and upper bounds 
for the $j$-th element of $\mathbf{p}$.
In equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}, $\alpha_{\ell}$ is the weight assigned to the 
$\ell$-th regularizing function $\Psi_{\ell}(\mathbf{p})$, $\ell = 0, 1, 2, 3$, and
$\Phi(\mathbf{p})$ is the misfit function given by
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{N} \| \mathbf{d}^{o} - \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{p}) \|_{2}^{2} 
\: , 
\label{eq:misfit-function}
\end{equation}
where $\| \cdot \|_{2}^{2}$ represents the squared Euclidean norm. Details about 
the regularizing functions $\Psi_{\ell}(\mathbf{p})$, $\ell = 0, 1, 2, 3$ and the 
numerical procedure to solve this non-linear inverse problem are given in the following 
sections.


\subsection{Isostatic constraint}

Consider that the interpretation model (Figure \ref{fig:interpretation-model})
is in isostatic equilibrium \citep{turcotte-schubert2002, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005, 
lowrie2007}, so that the lithostatic stress (pressure) is constant on the isostatic 
compensation surface $S_{0}$.
Let us also consider that no vertical forces are acting on the lateral surfaces of 
each column forming the model.
Based on these assumptions, we may write the following expression:
\begin{equation}
t^{(w)}_{i} \rho^{(w)} + t^{(1)}_{i} \rho^{(1)}_{i} + \dots + 
t^{(Q)}_{i} \rho^{(Q)}_{i} + t^{(c)}_{i} \rho^{(c)}_{i} + t^{(m)}_{i} \rho^{(m)} 
= \tau \: ,
\label{eq:lithostatic-stress-densities}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is an arbitrary positive constant representing the ratio of
lithostatic stress to the mean gravity value on the study area.
By rearranging terms in equation~\ref{eq:lithostatic-stress-densities} 
and using the relation
\begin{equation}
S_{0} = t^{(w)}_{i} + t^{(1)}_{i} + \dots + t^{(Q)}_{i} + t^{(c)}_{i} + t^{(m)}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:S0}
\end{equation}
it is possible to show that:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(Q)}_{i} \, t^{(Q)}_{i} + 
\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(m)}_{i} \, t^{(m)}_{i} + 
\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(w)}_{i} \, t^{(w)}_{i} + 
\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(1)}_{i} \, t^{(1)}_{i} +
\dots + 
\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(Q-1)}_{i} \, t^{(Q-1)}_{i} +
\rho^{(c)}_{i} \, S_{0} = \tau \: ,
\label{eq:lithostatic-stress-density-contrasts}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(\alpha)}_{i} = \rho^{(\alpha)}_{i} - \rho^{(c)}_{i}$, 
$\alpha = w, 1, \dots, Q-1, Q, m$.
In order to describe the lithostatic stress exerted by all columns forming the
interpretation model on the surface $S_{0}$, 
equation~\ref{eq:lithostatic-stress-density-contrasts} 
can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}^{(Q)} \mathbf{t}^{(Q)} + \mathbf{M}^{(m)} \mathbf{t}^{(m)} + \mathbf{M}^{(w)}
\mathbf{t}^{(w)} + \mathbf{M}^{(1)} \mathbf{t}^{(1)} + \dots + \mathbf{M}^{(Q-1)}
\mathbf{t}^{(Q-1)} + \boldsymbol{\rho}^{(c)} S_{0} = \tau \mathbf{1} \: ,
\label{eq:lithostatic-stress-matrix}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{1}$ is an $N \times 1$ vector with all elements equal to one, 
$\mathbf{t}^{(\alpha)}$, $\alpha = w, 1, \dots, Q-1, Q, m$, is a $N \times 1$ vector
with $i$-th element defined by the thickness $t^{(\alpha)}_{i}$ of a prism in the
$i$-th column, $\mathbf{M}^{(\alpha)}$ is an $N \times N$ diagonal matrix whose  
elements in the main diagonal are defined by the density contrasts 
$\Delta \tilde{\rho}^{(\alpha)}_{i}$, $i = 1, \dots, N$, of the prisms in a layer and
$\boldsymbol{\rho}^{(c)}$ is an $N \times 1$ vector containing the densities of the prisms
representing the crust. By applying the first-order Tikhonov regularization
\citep{aster-etal2005} to the constant vector $\tau \mathbf{1}$, we obtain the
following expression:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} \left( \mathbf{C} \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{t} \right) = \mathbf{0} 
\: ,
\label{eq:tik1-lithostatic-stress}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{0}$ is a vector with null elements and the remaining terms are given by:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{M}^{(Q)} & \mathbf{M}^{(m)} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix}_{N \times M} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-C}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{M}^{(w)} & \mathbf{M}^{(1)} & \cdots & \mathbf{M}^{(Q-1)} &
\boldsymbol{\rho}^{(c)}
\end{bmatrix}_{N \times \left( QN + 1 \right)} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-D}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{t} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{t}^{(w)} \\ \mathbf{t}^{(1)} \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{t}^{(Q-1)} \\ S_{0}
\end{bmatrix}_{\left( QN + 1 \right) \times 1}\: ,
\label{eq:vector-t}
\end{equation}
and $\mathbf{R}$ is an $\left( N-1 \right) \times N$ matrix, whose element 
$ij$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\left[ \mathbf{R} \right]_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 &, \quad j = i \\
-1 &, \quad j = i + 1 \\
0 &, \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \quad .
\label{eq:matrix-R}
\end{equation}
Finally, from equation~\ref{eq:tik1-lithostatic-stress}, it is possible to
define the regularizing function $\Psi_{0}(\mathbf{p})$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}): 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{0}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{W} \, \mathbf{R} \left( \mathbf{C} \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{D}
\mathbf{t} \right) \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:isostatic-constraint-function}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{W}$ is an $(N - 1) \times (N - 1)$ diagonal matrix having constant
elements $0 < w_{ii} \le 1$, $i = 1, \dots, N - 1$. 
Function $\Psi_{0}(\mathbf{p})$ defines the \textit{Isostatic constraint}.

Notice that, by minimizing the function $\Psi_{0}(\mathbf{p})$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:isostatic-constraint-function}), the method imposes smoothness on 
the lithostatic stress exerted by the interpretation model on the isostatic 
compensation surface $S_{0}$.
Matrix $\mathbf{W}$ controls the relative amount of isostatic equilibrium imposed 
along the profile. 
In the particular case in which all diagonal elements $w_{ii}$ have the same
constant value, the same amount of isostatic equilibrium is imposed along the 
whole profile. On the other hand, different amounts of isostatic equilibrium
can be imposed along the profile by varying the values of these elements.
Elements $w_{ii} \approx 1$ impose a smooth lithostatic stress curve 
at the transition between columns $i$ and $i+1$ of the interpretation model.
Elements $w_{ii} \approx 0$ allow abrupt variations in the lithostatic stress 
curve between columns $i$ and $i+1$ of the interpretation model.
By using all elements $w_{ii} = 1$, we impose full isostatic equilibrium 
along the entire profile. Alternatively, we may allow the interpretation model 
deviates from the isostatic equilibrium by conveniently decreasing the numerical values
assigned to the elements $w_{ii}$ at specific regions along the profile. 
The strategy used to define the elements $w_{ii}$ is 
presented in the specific section describing the numerical solution of the inverse problem.


\subsection{Smoothness constraint}


This constraint imposes smoothness on the adjacent thickness of the prisms forming the
deepest portion of the second layer and the shallowest part of the fourth layer
of the interpretation model by applying the first-order Tikhonov regularization
\citep{aster-etal2005} to the vectors $\mathbf{t}^{(Q)}$ and $\mathbf{t}^{(m)}$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:parameter-vector}). 
Mathematically, this constraint is represented by the regularizing function
$\Psi_{1}(\mathbf{p})$ (equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}):
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{1}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{S}\mathbf{p} \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:smootheness-contraint}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{S}$ is an $\left( N-1 \right) \times M$ matrix given by:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{R} & \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix} \: ,
\label{eq:matrix-S}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{R}$ is defined by equation~\ref{eq:matrix-R} and $\mathbf{0}$
is a vector with all elements equal to zero.


\subsection{Equality constraint}

\subsubsection*{Equality constraint on basement depths}

Let $\mathbf{a}$ be a vector whose $k$-th element $a_{k}$,
$k = 1, \dots, A$, is the known basement depth at the horizontal coordinate
$y^{A}_{k}$ of the profile. These known basement depth values are used to define 
the regularizing function $\Psi_{2}(\mathbf{p})$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}):
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{2}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{A}\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a} \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:equality-constraint-basement}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ is an $A \times M$ matrix whose $k$-th line has one element 
equal to one and all the remaining elements equal to zero. The location of the
single non-null element in the $k$-th line of $\mathbf{A}$ depends on the coordinate
$y^{A}_{k}$ of the known basement depth $a_{k}$. Let us consider, 
for example, an interpretation model formed by $N = 10$ columns. Consider also that 
the basement depth at the coordinates $y^{A}_{1} = y_{4}$ and $y^{A}_{2} = y_{9}$ of
the profile are equal to $25$ and $35.7$ km, respectively. In this case, $A = 2$,
$\mathbf{a}$ is a $2 \times 1$ vector with elements $a_{1} = 25$ and $a_{2} = 35.7$
and $\mathbf{A}$ is a $2 \times M$ matrix ($M = 2N + 1 = 21$). The element $4$ of the
first line and the element $9$ of the second line of $\mathbf{A}$ are equal to $1$ and
all its remaining elements are equal to zero.

\subsubsection*{Equality constraint on Moho depths}

Let $\mathbf{b}$ be a vector whose $k$-th element $b_{k}$,
$k = 1, \dots, B$, is the difference between the isostatic compensation depth
$S_{0}$ and the known Moho depth at the horizontal coordinate $y^{B}_{k}$ of the
profile. These differences, which must be positive, are used to define the 
regularizing function $\Psi_{3}(\mathbf{p})$ (equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}):
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{3}(\mathbf{p}) = \| \mathbf{B}\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{b} \|_{2}^{2} \: ,
\label{eq:equality-constraint-moho}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{B}$ is a $B \times M$ matrix whose $k$-th line has one element 
equal to one and all the remaining elements equal to zero. This matrix is defined 
in the same way as matrix $\mathbf{A}$ (equation~\ref{eq:equality-constraint-basement}).


\subsection{Computational procedures for solving of the inverse problem}

The parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$ (equation~\ref{eq:parameter-vector}) minimizing the
goal function $\Gamma (\mathbf{p})$ (equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}), subjected to
the inequality constraint (equation~\ref{eq:inequality-constraint}), is estimated 
in three steps. At each step, the goal function is minimized by using the Levenberg-Marquardt 
method \citep{aster-etal2005} and the inequality constraint 
(equation~\ref{eq:inequality-constraint}) is incorporated by using the same strategy 
employed by \citet{barbosa-etal1999}.
All derivatives of the misfit function $\Phi(\mathbf{p})$ (equation~\ref{eq:misfit-function})
with respect to the parameters are computed by using a finite difference approximation.

The first step consists in solving the inverse problem without imposing the isostatic
constraint, by using $\alpha_{0} = 0$ (equation \ref{eq:goal-function}). For this step,
the interpreter must set:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{Parameters defining the interpretation model
	(Figure~\ref{fig:interpretation-model}):} density contrasts $\Delta \rho^{(\alpha)}$, 
	$\alpha = w, 1, \dots, Q, cc, oc, m$, of the four layers, COT position $y_{COT}$ and
	isostatic compensation depth $S_{0}$. Figure \ref{fig:interpretation-model} illustrates 
	the case in which the second layer is formed by $Q = 2$ parts. This number, however, 
	can be changed according to the study area.
	\item \underline{Parameters for the inversion:} weights $\alpha_{\ell}$,
	$\ell = 1, 2, 3$ (equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}), associated to the 
	smoothness and equality constraints (equations \ref{eq:smootheness-contraint},
	\ref{eq:equality-constraint-basement} and \ref{eq:equality-constraint-moho})
	and an initial approximation $\mathbf{p}_{0}$ for the parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$
	(equation~\ref{eq:parameter-vector}). The initial approximation $\mathbf{p}_{0}$
	must satisfy the inequality constraints (equation~\ref{eq:inequality-constraint}).
\end{itemize}
The estimated parameter vector obtained at the end of this first step is conveniently called
$\mathbf{p}^{(0)}$. The main goal in this step is finding suitable values for the parameters
defining the interpretation model and those used for inversion. Several trials may be
necessary to find suitable values for these parameters. 

The second step consists in obtaining an estimated parameter vector $\mathbf{p}^{(1)}$
by imposing full isostatic equilibrium on the interpretation model along the entire profile.
In this step, the interpreter must use the previously obtained estimate
$\mathbf{p}^{(0)}$ as initial approximation for the parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:parameter-vector}). Additionally, the interpreter must find a suitable 
value for the weight $\alpha_{0} = 0$ (equation \ref{eq:goal-function}) controlling the 
isostatic constraint, by using the matrix $\mathbf{W}$
(equation~\ref{eq:isostatic-constraint-function}) equal to the identity.
We presume that, by imposing full isostatic equilibrium along the entire profile,
the estimated parameter vector $\mathbf{p}^{(1)}$ will produce a good data fit,
except at some isolated regions, where there will be hight residuals between the
observed and predicted data. We assume that, at these regions, the study area deviates
from the isostatic equilibrium described by the Airy's local model.

Finally, the third step consists in obtaining an estimated parameter vector $\mathbf{p}^{(2)}$
by imposing different amounts of isostatic equilibrium on the interpretation model along the
entire profile. Specifically, this step aims at computing diagonal elements $w_{ii}$ of the
matrix $\mathbf{W}$ (equation~\ref{eq:isostatic-constraint-function}) that allow deviations 
of the interpretation model from the isostatic equilibrium at the regions presenting high
residuals between the observed and predicted data. At this step, the elements of $\mathbf{W}$
are computed as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:elements-wii}
w_{ii} = 
\exp \left[ - \frac{ \left( r_{i}^{(1)} + r_{i+1}^{(1)} \right)^{2}}{4 \sigma} \right] \: ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is a positive constant, $\mathbf{p}^{(1)}$ is the estimate parameter vector
obtained in the previous step and the variables
$r_{i}^{(1)} = d^{o}_{i} - d_{i} \left( \mathbf{p}^{(1)} \right)$ and 
$r_{i+1}^{(1)} = d^{o}_{i+1} - d_{i+1} \left(\mathbf{p}^{(1)} \right)$ represent,
respectively, the residuals between observed and predicted data
(equation~\ref{eq:ith-predicted-data}) at the positions $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ and 
$(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}, z_{i+1})$. Equation~\ref{eq:elements-wii} defines elements 
$w_{ii}$ in the interval $\left] 0, 1 \right]$. Additionally, it results in 
$w_{ii} \approx 1$ at regions where the residuals are close to zero and 
$w_{ii} \approx 0$ at regions presenting high residual values. 
This strategy to define the elements of matrix $\mathbf{W}$ 
(equation\ref{eq:isostatic-constraint-function}) presumes that the isostatic constraint may
produce large residuals at some regions along the profile. To counteract this problem,
our method allows the interpretation model deviates from isostatic equilibrium at these 
regions. This idea is in perfect agreement with the fact that the isostatic equilibrium
in a continental margin cannot be perfectly explained by using the Airy's local model.

Other important aspect of our method is related to the values attributed to 
the weights $\alpha_{\ell}$ (equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}).
Their values can be very dependent on the particular characteristics of the 
interpretation model and there is no analytical rule to define them. 
To overcome this problem, we normalize the $\alpha_{\ell}$ values as follows:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\ell} = \tilde{\alpha}_{\ell} \, \frac{E_{\Phi}}{E_{\ell}} \: 
, \quad \ell = 0, 1, 2, 3 \: ,
\label{eq:constraint-weights}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\alpha}_{\ell}$ is a positive scalar and $E_{\Phi} / E_{\ell}$
is a normalizing constant. In this equation, $E_{\ell}$ represents the median 
of the elements forming the main diagonal of the Hessian matrix of the 
$\ell$-th constraining function $\Psi_{\ell}(\mathbf{p})$ 
(equations~\ref{eq:isostatic-constraint-function}, 
\ref{eq:smootheness-contraint}, \ref{eq:equality-constraint-basement} and 
\ref{eq:equality-constraint-moho}). The constant $E_{\Phi}$ is defined in 
a similar way by using the Hessian matrix of the misfit function $\Phi(\mathbf{p})$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:misfit-function}). 
Both $E_{\Phi}$ and $E_{\ell}$ are defined by using the Hessian matrix computed with 
the initial approximation $\mathbf{p}_{0}$ for the parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$ 
(equation~\ref{eq:parameter-vector}) at the first step to solve the inverse problem.
According to this empirical strategy, the weights $\alpha_{\ell}$ are defined 
by using the positive scalars $\tilde{\alpha}_{\ell}$ 
(equation \ref{eq:constraint-weights}), which are less dependent on the particular 
characteristics of the interpretation model.


\section{Applications to synthetic data}


We have simulated a simple volcanic margin model formed by four layers: 
water, sediments + seaward dipping reflectors, crust (continental and oceanic) 
and mantle. 

The density contrasts associated with each layer are shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:volcanic-margin-model}.


PAREI AQUI

The reference density $\rho^{(r)}$ is equal to
that of the continental crust.
Similarly to the simple model II (Figures~\ref{fig:simple-model-II-without-isostatic-constraint}
and \ref{fig:simple-model-II-all-constraints}), our volcanic margin model
shows a significant crustal thinning at the first part of
the profile.
Figures~\ref{fig:volcanin-margin-without-isostatic-constraint} and 
\ref{fig:volcanin-margin-all-constraints} show the results obtained,
respectively, by using and not using the isostatic constraint to estimate
the geometries of basement and Moho.
The weights $\alpha_{\ell}$ (equation~\ref{eq:goal-function}) used
to obtain the result shown in the first figure were defined with
$\tilde{\alpha}_{\ell}$ (equation~\ref{eq:constraint-weights}) equal to: 
$\tilde{\alpha}_{0} = 0$, $\tilde{\alpha}_{1} = 10^{-1}$, 
$\tilde{\alpha}_{2} = 10^{0}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}_{3} = 10^{0}$.
The $\tilde{\alpha}_{\ell}$ (equation~\ref{eq:constraint-weights}) used to
obtain the result shown in Figure~\ref{fig:volcanin-margin-all-constraints} 
are given by: $\tilde{\alpha}_{0} = 10^{0}$, $\tilde{\alpha}_{1} = 10^{-1}$, 
$\tilde{\alpha}_{2} = 10^{0}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}_{3} = 10^{0}$.

We can see that, without using the isostatic constraint, out method could not 
retrieve the pronounced crustal thinning located at the first part of our
volcanic margin model. As shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:volcanin-margin-without-isostatic-constraint},
the difference between the estimated and true basement reach
$\approx 10$ km at the position $\approx 75$ km on the profile.
On the other hand, as in the previous test with the simple model II, 
the isostatic constraint was able to produce an estimated basement
very close to the true one (Figure~\ref{fig:volcanin-margin-all-constraints}).


\section{Application to real data}

We applied our method to interpret a gravity profile over the Pelotas basin
\citep{stica-etal2014}, located at the southern of Brazil. This basin is considered
a classical example of volcanic margin \citep{geoffroy2005} showing ...
