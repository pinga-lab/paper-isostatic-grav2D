%We propose a new gravity inversion method for jointly estimating the basement and 
%Moho reliefs along a profile crossing a passive rifted margin.
%We approximate the subsurface by an interpretation model composed of 
%adjacent columns, each one formed by vertically stacked prisms having constant 
%and known density contrasts.
%Our method consists in solving a non-linear inverse problem to estimate the 
%thickness of specific prisms defining the basement and Moho geometries, 
%as well as a constant thickness defining the maximum depth of our interpretation 
%model.
%This maximum depth represents a planar reference Moho.
%To obtain stable solutions, we impose smoothness on the basement and Moho relief,
%force them to be close to known depths along the profile and also impose
%isostatic equilibrium according to the Airy-Heiskanen model.
%Our method imposes isostatic equilibrium by constraining the lithostatic stress 
%exerted by the interpretation model at a given constant depth, 
%below which there are no lateral density variations.
%This isostatic constraint introduces the information that the lithostatic stress 
%is mostly smooth, except at some isolated regions, where it can present abrupt 
%variations. At these regions, our method enables the interpretation model to deviate
%from the isostatic equilibrium.
%Tests with synthetic data show the good performance of our method in
%determining the basement and Moho geometries at regions with  
%pronounced crustal thinning, which is typical of passive volcanic margins.
%Results obtained by our method at the Pelotas basin, considered a classical example
%of passive volcanic margin at the southern of Brazil, agree with a previous
%interpretation obtained independently by using ultra-deep seismic data.
%The applications to synthetic and real data show that our method is a
%promising tool for interpreting gravity data on passive rifted margins.

\section{Applications to synthetic data - Sensitivity to the isostatic compensation depth}

We tested the sensitivity to the isostatic compensation depth by keeping constant the true Moho reference thickness ($43.2$ km) and show the results of steps 2 and 3. Parameters defining the interpretation model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:volcanic-margin-model}.  We used the same parameters for inversion used in the synthetic applications of the paper.

Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2} and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3} show the estimated model obtained at the Step 2 and Step 3 of our algorithm with isostatic compensation depth adopted in the applications of the paper ($41$ km). 

Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test1} (First S0 guess) and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2} (Second S0 guess) show the estimated model obtained at the end of Step 2 where the isostatic compensation depths was defined at $39$ km and $43.2$ km at interpretive model, respectively.  These models presented basement and Moho reliefs closer to the estimated surfaces in the Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2}. In the same way, these results (Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test1} and ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2-test2}) show predicted gravity disturbance and lithostatic stress curves with the same behavior that presented in the Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step2}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test1} (First S0 guess) and Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test2} (Second S0 guess) show the estimated model obtained at the end of Step 3. We used different $\sigma$ constants for the tests. These models presented basement and Moho reliefs closer to the estimated surfaces in the Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3}. These results (Figures~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test1} and ~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3-test2}) show predicted gravity disturbance and lithostatic stress curves with the same behavior that presented in the Figure~\ref{fig:volc-margem-step3}.
